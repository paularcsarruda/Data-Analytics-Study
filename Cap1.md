In a technical sense, data analytics can be described as the process of using data to answer questions, identify trends, and extract insights. There are multiple types of analytics that can generate information to drive innovation, improve efficiency, and mitigate risk.

There are four key types of data analytics, and each answers a different type of question:

>
> - Descriptive analytics asks, “What happened?”
> - Predictive analytics asks, “What might happen in the future?”
> - Prescriptive analytics asks, “What should be done next?”
> - Diagnostic analytics asks, “Why did this happen?”
>

Each of the above types has its own unique insights, advantages, and disadvantages. Used in combination they provide a more complete understanding of the business's needs and opportunities.
