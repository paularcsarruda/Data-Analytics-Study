In a technical sense, data analytics can be described as the process of using data to answer questions, identify trends, and extract insights. There are multiple types of analytics that can generate information to drive innovation, improve efficiency, and mitigate risk.

There are four key types of data analytics, and each answers a different type of question:

>
> - Descriptive analytics asks, “What happened?”
> - Predictive analytics asks, “What might happen in the future?”
> - Prescriptive analytics asks, “What should be done next?”
> - Diagnostic analytics asks, “Why did this happen?”
>

Each of the above types has its own unique insights, advantages, and disadvantages. Used in combination they provide a more complete understanding of the business's needs and opportunities.

## 1.1. Descriptive Analytics

Descriptive analytics primarily uses observed data to identify key characteristics of a data set. It relies solely on historical data to provide reports on past events. This type of analysis is also used to generate ad hoc (as needed) reports that summarize large amounts of data to answer simple questions like “how much?” or “how many?” It can also be used to ask deeper questions about a specific problem. Descriptive analytics is not used to draw inferences or predictions from its findings; it is just a starting point used to inform decisions or to prepare data for further analysis.

The descriptive analytics process is as follows:

Ask a historical question that needs an answer, such as “How much of product X did we sell last year?”
Identify required data to answer the question
Collect and prepare data
Analyze data
Present results
Examples of descriptive analytics include:

Summarizing historical events such as sales, inventory, or operations data
Understanding engagement data such as likes and dislikes or volume of page views over time
Reporting general trends like revenue growth or employee injuries
Collating survey results
